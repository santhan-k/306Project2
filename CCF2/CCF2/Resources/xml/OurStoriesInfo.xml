    <content>Dequarn is now five and started school at the beginning of the year at Pukekohe Hill Primary.

Dequarn was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in 2009 and completed treatment in February this year.

Dequarn loves everything about school - the kids, the environment - and is always happy to go.  He particularly enjoys physical education, and was relieved to have his portacath removed earlier this year.  Before treatment Dequarn, who is of Maori and Cook Island heritage, used to have long curly hair worn in a plait. These days he is sporting a Mohawk!

    <content>Joyce was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in November 2009 and finished treatment in March this year.

She is now enjoying going to school at Valley School in Pukekohe where she enjoys sports, maths and reading.

Joyce’s big passion is now karate, which she got into after her best friend took it up. She enjoys the moves and learning how to defend herself.  Joyce loved doing TV work when she was an ambassador for CCF and wanted to be a model. She has changed her mind now though. She doesn’t want to model, but would still like to be on TV as a presenter one day.
