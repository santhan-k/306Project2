      Child Cancer Foundation has three holiday homes available to our children with cancer and their families. We have homes in Taupo, Arrowtown and Hawkes Bay. All our houses can be booked rent free for one week. The homes are well-resourced and provide families with the opportunity to spend time together in a relaxing setting.

      Long months of treatment can take a significant financial and emotional toll on families, and finding funds for a much-needed holiday can be very difficult. Child Cancer Foundation Holiday Homes help overcome this barrier.

      Families have opportunity to spend time together in a relaxing setting away from normal stressors. The holiday homes provide the perfect place for families to take time out and find strength to continue their journey.

      Other families use the facilities to celebrate milestones or honour their deceased child.

      If your family would like to book a holiday home please contact:

      Calling all bead makers! Become a Beads of Courage® bead maker and help recognise the strength of children with cancer.

      The Beads of Courage® programme helps children cope by decreasing their illness-related distress, increases the use of positive coping strategies, helps them to find meaning in their illness and helps to restore their sense of self through creativity.  The programme also provides something tangible that a child can use to tell family and care-givers about their experience during treatment. The beads also help explain to teachers and friends what has happened to them whilst they have been away from school. Parents of younger children enrolled in the programme can use the beads in the future to explain to their child what they have been through. With each procedure or milestone in their treatment, they get a special bead.

      The Beads of Courage® Programme depends upon two types of beads:

      1. Program Beads. These are the vast majority of beads used in the program. These beads are commercially manufactured due largely to the sheer numbers involved. These beads are the ones that you may have seen on bead guides that correspond to specific events in treatment. We don’t ask artists to make programme beads.

      2. Act of Courage Beads. These are the artist-made glass beads that are given to acknowledge the milestones in their treatment journey.
